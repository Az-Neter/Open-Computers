# Open-Computers
Lua files I've made for Open Computers (Minecraft mod for 1.7.10).   
Some code requires other mods as dependencies.  
Most non-lua files here are only for use on Az:Net's server.
 
 Any code I didn't personally write is used as a dependency, so please don't yell at me if you're the author; your code was already public.
